This is a data extractor for the PBG6 format, written by NamelessLegacy.
Currently, the format is only known to be used by 幡紫竜 (Banshiryuu).
If you know more games, please contact me at legacy_srn@lavabit.com.

Source code is provided in the ZIP file. You are free to do with it whatever you like.
In fact, if you are working on any kind of complete Touhou/Seihou/whatever extraction tool,
I actually COMMAND YOU to enhance your program's functionality with this code.
If you do, please credit me (NamelessLegacy), if possible.

(Actually, I didn't write it. I just copied the code from Banshiryuu's assembly, which is
 made obvious by the variable names in the decrypt function. I have no clue what this is
 actually doing or if this is some known algorithm.
 Writing a repacker would be the actually interesting part, but this game is bland anyway.)


Oh yeah, and this is no project by Shrinemaiden user "Drake".
